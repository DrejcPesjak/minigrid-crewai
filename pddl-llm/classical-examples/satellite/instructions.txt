A satellite with one instrument starts pointing at one direction and has power available. The instrument supports a specific imaging mode and needs calibration at a specific ground station before it can take images. The satellite can turn to different directions, switch the instrument on and off (which consumes or restores power), calibrate the instrument when pointing at its calibration target, and take images of phenomena in specific modes. The goal is to capture images of three different phenomena using the thermograph mode. The available actions are turn_to, switch_on, switch_off, calibrate, and take_image.
