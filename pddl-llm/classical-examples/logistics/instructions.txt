We have six cities, each with a local truck, two locations (one regular location and one airport), two airplanes, and six packages distributed across various locations. Trucks can only drive within their own city between locations, while airplanes can fly between any airports. Packages need to be loaded onto trucks or airplanes, transported, and unloaded at their destinations. The goal is to deliver each of the six packages to specific target locations across different cities. The available actions are load-truck, load-airplane, unload-truck, unload-airplane, drive-truck, and fly-airplane.
