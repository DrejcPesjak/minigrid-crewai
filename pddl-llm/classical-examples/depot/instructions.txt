We have three locations: one depot and two distributors. There are two trucks, one at the depot and one at a distributor. Each location has a hoist that can lift and drop crates. There are three pallets: one at the depot with a crate on it, one at the first distributor with a crate on it, and one empty at the second distributor. The goal is to swap the crates so the depot's crate ends up on the pallet at the first distributor and the first distributor's crate ends up on the pallet at the second distributor. The available actions are drive, lift, drop, load, and unload.
