A car has a flat wheel mounted on a hub with a nut holding it tight, and the hub is on the ground in a fastened state. In the closed boot there is a spare wheel, a jack, a pump, and a wrench. The goal is to replace the flat wheel with the inflated spare wheel: open the boot, fetch the tools and spare wheel, jack up the hub, loosen and remove the nut, take off the flat wheel, put on the spare wheel, fasten the nut, jack down the hub, tighten the nut, inflate the spare wheel, put everything back in the boot, and close it. The available actions are open-container, close-container, fetch, put-away, loosen, tighten, jack-up, jack-down, undo, do-up, remove-wheel, put-on-wheel, and inflate.
