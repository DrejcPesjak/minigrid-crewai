A rover equipped with a camera, soil analysis tools, and rock analysis tools starts at one waypoint with an empty storage unit. The rover can navigate between visible waypoints, collect soil and rock samples at specific locations, and take images of objectives using its camera after calibrating it. The rover must communicate collected data back to a lander when both are at mutually visible waypoints. The goal is to obtain and communicate specific soil data, rock data, and images of certain objectives in specific imaging modes. The available actions are navigate, sample_soil, sample_rock, drop, calibrate, take_image, communicate_soil_data, communicate_rock_data, and communicate_image_data.
