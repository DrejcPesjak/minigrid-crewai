A robot starts on a flat 4x4 grid at a depot position with no blocks in hand. The robot can move to neighboring positions at the same height, move up or down to positions one level higher or lower, create blocks at the depot, place blocks on neighboring positions to increase their height, remove blocks from neighboring positions, and destroy blocks at the depot. The goal is to build two towers of different heights at specific positions on the grid while ensuring the robot has no block in hand at the end. The available actions are move, move-up, move-down, place-block, remove-block, create-block, and destroy-block.
