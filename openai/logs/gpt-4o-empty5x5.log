result: explanation='The agent is currently facing a wall and needs to turn left to move towards the goal which is visible to the south-east in previous observations.

result: explanation='I currently face North and am blocked by walls on all visible directions. From the observation history, I know that I was heading towards the goal which was to my East.

result: explanation="The agent is facing east according to its orientation 'agent_right'. Based on the current observation, there is a 'goal_green' directly south of the agent.

result: explanation="The agent currently is facing 'down', or South, where it has open paths in the grid. Directly in front of the agent, there is an 'empty' tile. To make progress towards the goal, which was seen to be two rows below and slightly to the right of the initial agent position in a previous observation, the agent should move forward into this 'empty' tile, adapting its orientation and position to make approaching the goal more feasible in subsequent moves." action=2
