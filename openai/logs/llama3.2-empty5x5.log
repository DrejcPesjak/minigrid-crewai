result: explanation="First, let's analyze the observation grid. I can see that my current position is to the right of an empty space, which means I am positioned at an empty square. Since my goal is to reach the green goal square, the most efficient direction for me to move in would be to head towards it. Considering the global map direction is East, and my immediate location is near an empty space on the right edge, turning left (0) does not seem immediately advantageous as that may take me further away from the goal. Therefore, we must first align ourselves directly with the green square's possible route relative to our current orientation. The closest route from where I'm currently situated would be heading right, toward where my agent is positioned at an empty square on the left edge adjacent to my direction given by east which can indeed reach the green object if followed forward correctly. However that must be done without stepping into wall walls or other obstacles blocking it so in our current orientation making a move further East is a logical next step." action=2

result: explanation="The current observation shows the agent's rightmost position is marked as empty, which indicates that there is no obstacle blocking the path ahead. Additionally, the goal square is visible in the eastern direction, suggesting a straight shot towards it. With this information, taking two steps forward should bring me closer to the goal and aligns with the current direction of East.

result: explanation="Based on the current observation grid, I see that there is an empty space directly in front of me, which suggests that I can move forward without any obstacles. With my current orientation as 'agent_right', I need to take a turn to face the direction East to reach the goal square that says 'goal_green'. However, since the agent's position does not change, and there is no other object in front for PICKUP (3) action, it must be either empty space or an unseen tile outside my visible range. In this scenario, given that PICKUP (3) action works only if the target object is directly in front of you. Therefore, since there is no available object in front of the agent, there isn't any option to do PICKUP (3). So, I choose not to pick up an object and instead turn right using Turn Right action.

result: explanation="To get to the green goal square, I need to move forward in the southern direction. The agent current position is at the bottom of the grid, so it's not possible to turn left or right without moving first. Turning left (0) is not a viable option as I would be facing away from my desired movement.
